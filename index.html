<h1> Hi I'm Anatole and I'm learning the HTML and CSS languages</h1>
<h2><img src="Image1.png" alt="photo de profile"></h2>    
<b1> I dont have some project that can be particulary interesting i just want to validate my year at IESEG,and more I think that privacy is something that is particulary important also I will continue this work without speeching about me so much.<br></b1>
<b2> This is why the next link will be anonymized except for linkedin, becausse i think that my personnal social media need to stay personnal and dont become corporate to be seen by my school.<br></b2> 
<h3> Esport</h3>
<b3> What i can say to you, is that im passionate of Esport and i will work on this space and I already help a team as a volonteer: <a href=https://boutiqueaegis.fr/> Aegis </a>( do not hesitate to buy a jersey!)
<h3> Fishing </h3>
<b4> I im a personn that love peoples but I regullary need to be alone and that sport gave me solitude and patience,I have practiced this discipline since childhood, so I am convinced that it can bring a lot to the genes who are passionate about it.</b4>
<h3> Music</h3>
<b5> music is a very important art in my life, even if I don't practice it yet I'm very interested in it. I listen to everything from Jazz to electro remixes of children's music.</b5>
